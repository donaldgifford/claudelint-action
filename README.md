# claudelint-action

A GitHub Action that runs
[claudelint](https://github.com/donaldgifford/claudelint) against a Claude Code
repository — CLAUDE.md files, skills, commands, agents, hooks, plugin manifests,
marketplace manifests, and MCP server declarations — and optionally uploads
results to GitHub Code Scanning.

## Quickstart

```yaml
name: claudelint
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: donaldgifford/claudelint-action@v1
```

The default format is `github` — diagnostics render as workflow annotations on
the PR. See **Inputs** below for the full set of knobs.

## Upload SARIF to Code Scanning

```yaml
name: claudelint
on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  actions: read

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: donaldgifford/claudelint-action@v1
        with:
          format: sarif
          upload-sarif: "true"
```

The Action writes SARIF to `${{ runner.temp }}/claudelint.sarif` and calls
`github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v4` internally — you do not need a second
step, but **Code Scanning must be enabled on the repo** (Settings → Code
security → Code scanning). The `security-events: write` permission authorizes
the upload, `actions: read` lets the step fetch workflow-run metadata for alert
fingerprinting, and `contents: read` is for checkout.

## Pin to a specific claudelint version

```yaml
- uses: donaldgifford/claudelint-action@v1
  with:
    version: v0.1.0
```

`latest` resolves to the most recent release tag at runtime via the GitHub API.
Pinning is recommended for deterministic CI.

## Inputs

| Name             | Default       | Description                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `version`        | `latest`      | claudelint release tag to download (e.g. `v0.1.0`).    |
| `path`           | `.`           | Space-separated paths to lint.                         |
| `format`         | `github`      | `text`, `json`, `github`, or `sarif`.                  |
| `config`         | _(discovery)_ | Explicit path to `.claudelint.hcl`.                    |
| `max-warnings`   | `-1`          | Fail when warnings exceed this count. `-1` disables.   |
| `upload-sarif`   | `false`       | If `true` and `format=sarif`, upload to Code Scanning. |
| `sarif-category` | `claudelint`  | Category name for the uploaded SARIF.                  |

## Outputs

| Name                | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `diagnostics-count` | Total diagnostics (errors + warnings + info).         |
| `error-count`       | Error-severity diagnostic count.                      |
| `sarif-path`        | Path to the generated SARIF file (if `format=sarif`). |

## Checksum verification

Every release of claudelint publishes `checksums.txt` alongside the binaries.
The Action downloads both and verifies the archive's SHA-256 before extraction.
A tampered release asset fails the run.

## Platform support

- **Linux (x64 / arm64)**: full support.
- **macOS (x64 / arm64)**: full support.
- **Windows (x64)**: best-effort; please open an issue if you hit a bug. Shell
  is `bash` (pwsh is not configured).
